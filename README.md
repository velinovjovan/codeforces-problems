# Codeforces Problems 🤔

A collection of my solutions to various Codeforces programming problems. Each solution is implemented in C++ and organized for clarity and easy reference.

## 🧠 About

This repository serves as a record of my progress and practice on Codeforces. Problems are solved across different difficulty levels, focusing on improving problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and competitive programming speed.

## 📈 Goals

* Solve at least 500 problems by the end of the year.
* Practice regularly with a focus on Div 2 C/D level problems.
* Strengthen mastery of data structures and algorithms.

## 🧩 Topics 

* Implementation
* Greedy algorithms
* Dynamic programming
* Graph theory
* Binary search
* Number theory
